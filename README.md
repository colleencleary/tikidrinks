# The Tipsy Tiki

A tropical drink directory created while attending General Assembly's WDI-R course. Check it out here: https://tipsytiki.herokuapp.com/

Made By:
* Colleen Cleary
* Kendra Moore
* Sean Briar Oâ€™Neill

Technologies Used:
* HTML
* CSS
* Express
* AngularJS
* Node.js
* Mongoose

Approach Taken: A MEAN stack, full CRUD app. As a group we collectively created a Trello board where we could easily manage and assign tasks. Back-end and Front-end functionality were created simultaneously with communication between members via Slack and Zoom.


User Stories: As a user, I can browse my favorite tropical beverages in a directory that I have created. I am able to log-in with a unique username and an encrypted password. Once logged in, I am able to edit and delete drinks, submit comments, and "like" drinks.

Unsolved Problems:

Notes: In the future, we would like to incorporate a Yelp API so users can search for tropical inspired drinks in their area and received reviews and ratings.
